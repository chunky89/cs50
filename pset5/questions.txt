0.  What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

An artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.

1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

The function getrusage and the data type struct rusage are used to examine the resource usage of a 
process. They are declared in sys/resource.h.

2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?

struct	rusage {
 	struct timeval ru_utime; /* user CPU time used */
 	struct timeval ru_stime; /* system CPU time used */
 	long ru_maxrss; /* maximum resident set size */
 	long ru_ixrss;  /* integral shared memory size */
 	long ru_idrss;  /* integral unshared data size */
 	long ru_isrss;	/* integral unshared stack size */
 	long ru_minflt;	/* page reclaims (soft page faults) */
 	long ru_majflt;	/* page faults (hard page faults) */
 	long ru_nswap;	/* swaps */
 	long ru_inblock; /* block input operations */
 	long ru_oublock; /* block output operations */
 	long ru_msgsnd;	 /* IPC messages sent */
 	long ru_msgrcv; /* IPC messages received */
 	long ru_nsignals; /* signals received */
 	long ru_nvcsw; /* voluntary context switches */
 	long ru_nivcsw; /* involuntary context switches */
};
There are 16 members in a variable of type struct rusage.

3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, 
even though we’re not changing their contents?

Because of the size of the structure is relatively large. If we pass by value, a whole copy of the structure
will be generated during the funtion call and waste of resources. If we instead pass by reference, the orginal
structure will be passed, because we are not changing anything, the system resource will therefore be saved.

4.  Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. 
In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a 
format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying 
on fscanf alone?

fgetc is a more effective tool for examining 1 character at a time, to check that it is a valid letter. Using 
fscanf will have problem in checking if every letter in the string is valid because it scans the string rather
than individual character.

6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const?

These are pointers to a constant character. These pointers cannot change the values that they are pointing to. 
This is useful for functions like load and check whose job is not to change the elements in the WORD/DICTIONARY
array, but only to read them.

7.  What data structure(s) did you use to implement your spell-checker? Be sure not to leave your answer at 
just "hash table," "trie," or the like. Expound on what’s inside each of your "nodes."

I defined a dictionary data structure that has two variables:
-- size, which keeps track of the number of words in the dictionary totally
-- letter, which is an array of 26 linked lists to store all alphabet words.

Each node in the linked list containds the word(string) and the pointer to the next node.

8.  How slow was your code the first time you got it working correctly?

The total time in completing the program is around 5s.

9.  What kinds of changes, if any, did you make to your code in order to improve its performance?

Can try another data structure such as tries, to improve the searching efficiency.

10. Do you feel that your code has any bottlenecks that you were not able to chip away at?
